## Wikipedia excerpts

[Great Firewall of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Firewall)

"The techniques deployed by the Chinese government to maintain control of the Great Firewall can include modifying search results for terms, such as they did following Ai Weiwei’s arrest, and petitioning global conglomerates to remove content, as happened when they petitioned Apple to remove the Quartz business news publication’s app from its Chinese App Store"

[The Firewall is] "used by the Chinese government to promote and encourage right thinking by censoring dissident ideas. One of the main goals of the Great Chinese firewall is to create an environment where people have the same values" and promote values like:
 - Taiwan, Hong Kong and Tibet are part of China.
 - 1989 Tiananmen Square protests should not be considered very important.
 - Prohibition of pornography and obscenity.
 - Democracy is not the best system for governing a country. As such pro-democracy groups should be considered as terrorists and Hong Kong protests are supposedly organized by foreign entities.
 - Falun Gong and other anti CCP groups, are "outlawed".

## How it works

[Deconstructing the Great Firewall of China](https://blog.thousandeyes.com/deconstructing-great-firewall-china/), *ThousandEyes* (2016). Goes over techniques like IP blocking (blacklisting IP addresses), DNS tampering (blocking at the domain level by falsifying DNS response), collateral damage from those and other techniques, in-path vs on-path systems

## Banning words as search terms

[Why China banned a ton of words](https://www.vox.com/2018/2/27/17058074/china-banned-words-jinping), *Vox* 2018. Censors block words and terms that even obliquely criticize the party.

## Political environment

[Emperor Xi's censors have no clothes](https://www.aspistrategist.org.au/emperor-xis-censors-no-clothes/), *The Strategist* (2018). A recounting of the real-time censorship response to debate about the removal of presidential term limits. 

[Young people in China don't know the Internet we do--and they like it that way](https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/features/china-internet-social-media-great-firewall-china-censorship-apps-a8510036.html), *The Independent* (2018). "For US and other western internet giants, the hope of getting a piece of the huge China market is increasingly a pipe dream." Mentions surveys conducted of young people indicating they're not interested in getting around censorship. From the report: "Our findings suggest that censorship in China is effective, not only because the regime makes it difficult to access sensitive information, but also because it fosters an environment in which citizens do not demand such information in the first place."
