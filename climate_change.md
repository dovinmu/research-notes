## Primers
[What can a technologist do about climate change?](http://worrydream.com/ClimateChange/) Some of the statistics are outdated

## Electrification
Offshore wind in Europe won't need subsidies anymore ([Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/07/offshore-wind-in-europe-wont-need-subsidies-much-longer/), July 2020)

## Carbon Sinks
[Patch](https://www.usepatch.com/), an API which claims to help companies automate their carbon neutralization

[American Carbon Registry](https://americancarbonregistry.org/how-it-works/what-we-do) has a [number of projects](https://acr2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp), including reforestation, methane capture, recycling or destroying

[Charm](https://charmindustrial.com), an "industrial bio-oil geo-sequestration" project in Kansas. They liquefy waste biomass using heat and pump it underground. Sounds expensive. From their [FAQs](https://charmindustrial.com/faqs): "every ton of bio-oil sequestered produces a net -1.44 tons COâ‚‚e across its life cycle of production to sequestration."

Indigo Agriculture's [Teraton Initiative](https://terraton.indigoag.com/challenge) is funding research into carbon sequestration in soil. They claim that we could sequester 1 teraton of carbon with soil from croplands, comparing historical carbon soil content with current.

## Geoengineering

## Impact
"Every degree of warming, it's been estimated, costs a temperate country like the United States about one percentage point of GDP." -*The Uninhabitable Earth*, referencing "[Estimating Economic Damage from Climate Change in the United States](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1362/tab-pdf)", Science

"Nature Climate Change [tried to quantify the suffering difference between 1.5C and 2C warming]. Their answer: 150 million more people would die from air pollution alone in a 2-degree warmer world than a 1.5-degree warmer one." -*The Uninhabitable Earth*, referencing "Quantified, Localized Health Benefits of Accelerated Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reductions"

Carbon Brief's [comparison](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/) of 1.5C of warming vs 2 degrees C

## Older, yet potentially interesting
[Whole Earth Discipline](http://discipline.longnow.org/DISCIPLINE_footnotes/Contents.html), a book by Stewart Brand which is pro-nuclear, pro-geoengineering, and skeptical of the most extreme projections of climate change. Published in 2009.
