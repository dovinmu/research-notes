[American Carbon Registry](https://americancarbonregistry.org/how-it-works/what-we-do) has a [number of projects](https://acr2.apx.com/myModule/rpt/myrpt.asp), including reforestation, methane capture, recycling or destroying

## Impact
"Every degree of warming, it's been estimated, costs a temperate country like the United States about one percentage point of GDP." -*The Uninhabitable Earth*, referencing "[Estimating Economic Damage from Climate Change in the United States](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/356/6345/1362/tab-pdf)", Science

"Nature Climate Change [tried to quantify the suffering difference between 1.5C and 2C warming]. Their answer: 150 million more people would die from air pollution alone in a 2-degree warmer world than a 1.5-degree warmer one." -*The Uninhabitable Earth*, referencing "Quantified, Localized Health Benefits of Accelerated Carbon Dioxide Emissions Reductions"

Carbon Brief's [comparison](https://interactive.carbonbrief.org/impacts-climate-change-one-point-five-degrees-two-degrees/) of 1.5C of warming vs 2 degrees C
